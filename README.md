# UNP-Project-with-Power-BI_US-Pollution

During my project with Power BI as part of my internship at United Network of Professionals(UNP).

Key Points:
1)In this project, I analyzed Air Quality Index (AQI) data for various pollutants using the US Pollution dataset.
2)Collaborated extensively with stakeholders to identify and fulfill their distinct requirements for Power BI solutions.
3)Took the initiative to develop Key Performing Indicators(KPIs), implement data transformations, and perform calculations using DAX to ensure precise data analysis and reporting.
4)Significantly enhanced data visualization and user-friendliness.
